## **Core Principles**

The implementation must strictly adhere to these non-negotiable
principles, as established in previous PRDs:

1.  DRY (Don\'t Repeat Yourself)

    - Zero code duplication will be tolerated

    - Each functionality must exist in exactly one place

    - No duplicate files or alternative implementations allowed

2.  KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

    - Implement the simplest solution that works

    - No over-engineering or unnecessary complexity

    - Straightforward, maintainable code patterns

3.  Clean File System

    - All existing files must be either used or removed

    - No orphaned, redundant, or unused files

    - Clear, logical organization of the file structure

4.  Transparent Error Handling

    - No error hiding or fallback mechanisms that mask issues

    - All errors must be properly displayed to the user

    - Errors must be clear, actionable, and honest

## **Success Criteria**

In accordance with the established principles and previous PRDs, the
implementation will be successful if:

1.  Zero Duplication: No duplicate code or files exist in the codebase

2.  Single Implementation: Each feature has exactly one implementation

3.  Complete Template System: All HTML is generated via the template
    > system

4.  No Fallbacks: No fallback systems that hide or mask errors

5.  Transparent Errors: All errors are properly displayed to users

6.  External Assets: All CSS and JavaScript is in external files

7.  Component Architecture: UI is built from reusable, modular
    > components

8.  Consistent Standards: Implementation follows UI integration standards

9.  Full Functionality: All features work correctly through template UI

10. Complete Documentation: Implementation details are properly
    > documented
